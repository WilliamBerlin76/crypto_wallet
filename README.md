# Crypto_Wallet

This app is a simple frontend representation of a user's balance and transactions on a blockchain

- This is intended to connect to a simple implementation of a blockchain server which uses Flask
- The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/WilliamBerlin76/Blockchain)
- The backend server should be run from the `basic_transactions_gp` directory, and a miner can be run from the `client_mining_p` directory
